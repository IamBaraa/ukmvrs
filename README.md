"UKM Vehicle Rental Service" is a university-based vehicle rental web-based system that gives the opportunity to students who own vehicles to 
earn extra income by leasing their vehicles, whereas those who do not own a vehicle are be able to rent one easily through the system.
Vehicles owners have to register themselves with their Matric number, so that they can add their vehicles to the system and change their 
availability status manually when needed. Customers also have to register with their Matric numbers to be able to use the system. Whenever 
a customer wants to rent a vehicle, all he/she needs to do is to log into the system and check the available vehicles, choose the one they like,
select (Date & Time) and click on "Book". The booked vehicle will automatically be hidden from the list of available vehicles as its status will 
change to be unavailable. Vehicle owners will be notified immediately via email so that they can contact the customer and deliver the vehicle to 
the customer's place.
