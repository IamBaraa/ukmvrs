"UKM Vehicle Rental Service" is a university-based vehicle rental web-based system that gives the opportunity to students who own vehicles to earn extra income by leasing their vehicles, whereas those who do not own a vehicle are able to rent one easily through the system. The system mainly plays the role of a man in the middle between vehicle owners and customers.

User types:
    1.	Vehicle owner
    2.	Customer

Note: Users are not asked to select one type only, as they can be both (customers or vehicle owners) based on the function they perform. In addition, users should be university students as they have to use their university emails which includes (.edu) to be able to register in the system.

        1.	Add their vehicles
        2.	Update their vehicles information
